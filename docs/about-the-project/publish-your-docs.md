# Business Model

### Overview

Shibaville is a fully on-chain city-building game where players can build, manage resources, and engage in strategic warfare. The game's economy is powered by Ville NFTs, energy refills, and marketplace transactions, which form the core of its revenue model.

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. Ville NFT Sales

**Description:**\
Ville NFTs are the foundational assets in Shibaville. Each player requires a Ville NFT to participate in the game. These NFTs represent a player’s ville and contain unique attributes, levels, and upgrade potentials.

**Revenue Mechanism:**

* **Initial Sale:** Players purchase Ville NFTs during the initial minting process. The price of each Ville NFT is determined by the demand and scarcity of available villes.
* **Upgrades:** Players can upgrade their Ville NFTs, unlocking new features, capabilities, and visual enhancements. Each upgrade requires a payment in SVGOLD tokens, a portion of which is burned, and the rest is collected as revenue.

**Sustainability:**

* The finite number of initial Ville NFTs and the continuous demand for upgrades ensure a steady stream of revenue.
* Future expansions can introduce new Ville NFTs, catering to new players and growing the community.

#### 2. Energy Refills

**Description:**\
Energy is a critical resource in Shibaville, used for performing actions such as building, resource gathering, and warfare. Players have a limited amount of energy that refills over time but can be replenished instantly by purchasing energy refills.

**Revenue Mechanism:**

* **Energy Purchases:** Players can buy energy refills using SVGOLD tokens, allowing them to continue playing without waiting for natural energy regeneration. The price for energy refills scales with usage and demand.

**Sustainability:**

* The demand for energy refills increases with the game’s progression, as more advanced actions require greater energy consumption.
* Regular in-game events or limited-time challenges can incentivize energy purchases, boosting revenue.

#### 3. Marketplace Fees

**Description:**\
Shibaville features an in-game marketplace where players can trade Ville NFTs, buildings, resources, and other assets. The marketplace facilitates player-to-player transactions, with a fee applied to each sale.

**Revenue Mechanism:**

* **Transaction Fees:** A percentage fee is charged on every transaction conducted in the marketplace. This fee is collected in SVGOLD tokens or native tokens, with a portion burned to maintain the token’s value and the remainder taken as revenue.
* **Listing Fees:** Players may also be charged a small fee to list their items on the marketplace, incentivizing active trading and reducing spam listings.

**Sustainability:**

* As the player base grows, the number of marketplace transactions increases, creating a scalable revenue stream.
* The rarity and value of in-game assets can drive high-value transactions, further boosting revenue from transaction fees.

### Business Sustainability

#### 1. Tokenomics

Shibaville’s economy is built around the SVGOLD token, which is used for various in-game activities such as upgrades, energy refills, and marketplace transactions. A well-balanced tokenomics model ensures the following:

* **Burn Mechanism:** A portion of SVGOLD used in transactions is burned, reducing the total supply over time and maintaining token value.
* **Incentives:** Players are rewarded with SVGOLD for completing certain milestones or participating in events, fostering a healthy in-game economy.

#### 2. Player Retention and Growth

* **Regular Content Updates:** Introducing new gameplay features, challenges, and NFTs ensures continuous engagement and player retention.
* **Referral System:** An incentivized referral system encourages players to invite others, contributing to organic growth.
* **Community Engagement:** Open-source development and community involvement create a loyal player base and foster innovation.

#### 3. Expansion Opportunities

* **New Ville NFTs and Buildings:** Introducing new NFT collections periodically can attract new players and provide existing players with fresh content.
* **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Expanding Shibaville to other blockchain networks can increase the player base and open up additional revenue streams.
* **In-Game Advertising:** As the player base grows, opportunities for in-game advertising and partnerships with brands can generate additional revenue.

### Financial Projections

#### 1. Initial Revenue Projections

* **Ville NFT Sales:** Projected to generate significant revenue during the initial minting phase and through ongoing upgrades.
* **Energy Refills:** Expected to be a consistent revenue stream, especially as players advance in the game.
* **Marketplace Fees:** Revenue will scale with the growth of the player base and the value of in-game assets.

#### 2. Long-Term Revenue Projections

* **Sustained NFT Sales:** Revenue from periodic releases of new Ville NFTs and buildings.
* **Ongoing Marketplace Activity:** As the game evolves, the marketplace will become a central hub for trading, driving continuous fee revenue.
* **In-Game Purchases:** Energy refills and other microtransactions will contribute to steady cash flow.
